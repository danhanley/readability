The lambda function uses the comiled python textstat library.
if you build this on Ubunu and package it you will get a cryptic error message about packages not being suported.

The upshot is you need to build textstat on the apropriate AMI that will host the lambda.

See: http://www.perrygeo.com/running-python-with-compiled-code-on-aws-lambda.html

I'll commit the correct version for running in AWS EU (Ireland). You may need to rebuild if running in other centres.

NB You also need to install setuptools in this directory

cd lambda

pip install textstat -t .
pip install --upgrade setuptools -t .
